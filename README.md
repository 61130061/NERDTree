## Installation

1. You can install NERDTree for VSCode via [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Llam4u.nerdtree).

### Vim User

There are conflicts between NERDTree VSCode keybindings and other extension.
To use NERDTree, we have to disable some keybinding from other extension first ‚ö†Ô∏è.
If you use any below extension, you can setup following the guide below.

 > If you find any conflict with other extension please let us know [here](https://github.com/61130061/NERDTree/issues).

#### VSCodeVim

This setting will disable `Ctrl + N` from VSCodeVim extension.

		"<C-n>": false,
	}
}
```
